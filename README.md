# Water_quality

This project is about how to predict water quality using artificial intelligence.
The aim is to create a tool that can anticipate water quality variations using historical data in real time, allowing people to intervene quickly if needed in order to keep water quality at an acceptable level.


## Specifications :

- Use registrations from 2018, 2019, and 2020

- Follow an Exploratory Data Analysis

- Select the most important features (not more than 10)

- Concatenate 3 databases (2018, 2019 and 2020)

- Reformulate the target ('Classification')

- Prepare data for AI model conception

- Try a few classification models and select the most efficient (change hyperparameters for each one)


If you want to try it for yourself, you will need to import the 3 files (data_2018, data_2019, and data_2020), then you can run the Jupyter notebook.
